# Sports Metrics EDA

I was the Project lead of this EDA [project](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025) from start to finish. My team included a Research Assistant, 2 Research Analysts and a Lead Coder.

This was an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that used a sample athlete metric dataset of a NCAA Tier 1 University. It involved the full EDA lifecycle (shown below) to get insights from the dataset about athletics sports performance.
